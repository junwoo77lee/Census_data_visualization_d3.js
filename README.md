# Census_data_visualization_d3.js
#### With Census ACS-1 year estimates dataset, data visualizations made by d3.js are:
* Correlation charts with regression line:
  * { Poverty, Age, Income } vs. { Healthcare, Smokes, Obesity } by state
  * Change the axes labels to interactively show each correlation
  
* Two choropleth map with the same features above
  * One is for x-axis features, another is for y-axis on the scatter plot
  * In response to the axes label changes, colormap changes for each feature
